  -d, --dir &lt;dir&gt;         Use the supplied folder as application root instead of the binary location (use '.' for current)

```

## What is an instance ID, and where do I find it?

The instance ID is the name of the folder where your instance is contained.

To find it, **right-click** on the instance you want to know the ID of, and then click on *Instance Folder* within the context menu.

Now, just copy the name of the folder that opened.

## Prism Launcher is still opening after I close Minecraft

Currently, the *Close Prism Launcher after game window opens* option opens Prism Launcher after closing Minecraft, even when launched from the CLI.

To disable this, open *Settings*, then select *Minecraft*, and finally, un-check *Close Prism Launcher after game window opens* or check *Quit the launcher after game window closes*.
