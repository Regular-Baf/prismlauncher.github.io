# Downloading Modpacks

Similar to [creating an Instance](../create-instance), downloading a modpack can be done through the **Add Instance** menu. Or alternatively, *right click > create instance*
You can now use the sidebar to the left of the window to choose from the following:

* Import from zip
* ATLauncher
* CurseForge
* FTB
* FTB Legacy
* Technic
* Modrinth

After selecting which service you wish to use, you can browse the modpacks which available to install.

The "**Import from zip**" option assumes that you have manually downloaded a modpack to your computer through other means, and will ask for a **.zip** archive containing a Prism Launcher compatible pack.
