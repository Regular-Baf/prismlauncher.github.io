# Creating an instance

To create an instance, simply click on the **Add Instance** button on the top menu bar, or right-click an empty area in the middle of the launcher, and select **Create instance**.

## Editing an instance

Once an instance is created, you can right-click it to open a context menu with some basic settings. From this list, select **Edit Instance** to access the edit menu.

### Configure instance java

Prism Launcher does not yet automatically set the right version of Java for your instance. To **manually** select a version of Java, open the **Settings** window from the top menu bar, select the **Java** tab on the left sidebar, and under **Java Runtime**, click **Auto-detect...**, and then choose your version accordingly. Our [Installing Java](../installing-java) page has more information on the correct versions of Java for each Minecraft version.
